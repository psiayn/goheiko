# Heiko

Heiko rewritten in go!

Heiko is a lightweight distributed node manager ( at least aims to be that ).

## Installation

### Using Go Get

```
go get github.com/psiayn/heiko
```

### From Source

```
git clone https://github.com/psiayn/heiko.git
cd heiko
go install .
```

## Usage

General overview.

```
Usage:
  heiko [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  init        Runs initialization of Jobs
  start       Start a new heiko job
  stop        Stops a running heiko daemon

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $PWD/.heiko/config.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for heiko
  -n, --name string     Unique name to give (or given) to this heiko job

Use "heiko [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Heiko uses a `config.yml` to store info about jobs and nodes of the cluster. A sample config has been provided in `examples/sample-config.yml`. The default path for the config is at `.heiko/config.yml` in the current directory where you would like to start heiko from. You can also specify config manually.

### Authentication

By default Heiko uses SSH keys for authentication. If no path to keys are specified, Heiko will attempt to generate a keypair at `~/.ssh/heiko/` and transfer them to the node (user will be prompted for auth in this case).

If on the other hand keys are specified, Heiko will directly attempt to establish a connection using the key (user is responsible to have transferred the keys prior to usage).

Finally, heiko does support the use of SSH passwords for authentication. Although, it is advised **not to use passwords** as they are stored as plain text in the config file.

### Basic Usage

```
heiko start/init --config path/to/config
```

You can initialize heiko, which for now runs the init jobs from your `config.yml`. More about the config can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/psiayn/heiko/wiki).

```
heiko init -n <name you want to give>
```

Starting heiko in normal mode

```
heiko start -n <name you want to give>
```

Starting heiko in daemon mode

```
heiko start -n <name you want to give> -d
```

Once your in daemon mode, you can stop the daemon as follows.

```
heiko stop -n <name of the daemon you gave earlier>
```
